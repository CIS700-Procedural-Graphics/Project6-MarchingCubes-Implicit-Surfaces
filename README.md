# Project 6: Implicit surfaces - Marching cubes

![](./screenshots/meta4.PNG)

**Note:** The cool looking tearing effect is not a feature. It's a bug. I am trying since yesterday to figure out what's causing it. I am out of ideas.

**Shader:** Did not get enough time to include any post shaders, but I did include the iridescence shader. Looks cool!
