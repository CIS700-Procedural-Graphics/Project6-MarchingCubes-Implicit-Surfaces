Lava Lamp

Shaders:
The lava is shaded with GLSL matcap shader, using a lit sphere texture. The color is smoothed with a cosine color mapping. I modeled the lamp in Maya. 

Since watching the lava lamp / metaballs and changing colors are so soothing, I decided to create a website with inspiration quotes (A new one each time the web page loads).
