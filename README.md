# Project 6: Implicit surfaces - Marching cubes

Implemented an isosurface created from 3-dimensional metaballs using the marching cubes algorithm. Positioned the metaballs to rotate in a circular motion at different speeds. The isosurface created from the metaballs morphs into a larger surface when the metaballs collide with one another. Used a lit sphere shader on the isosurface to give it a metallic look.
